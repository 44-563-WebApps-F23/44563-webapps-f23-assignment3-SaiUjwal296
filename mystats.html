    <h3>Salmon Fish</h3>
    <p>
        Salmons have sleek, streamlined bodies that typically change color throughout their lifetimes. 
        While in freshwater, Atlantic salmon are brown and spotted. 
        When they migrate to the ocean, they turn silvery. 
        Atlantic salmon are the largest salmon species, 
        typically growing to just under four feet in length.
